# Launcher Configuration
# The launcher-address here is the address of the Launcher server relative to the Workbench server.
launcher-address=localhost

# The launcher-port configured here must match the port configured in launcher.conf.
launcher-port=5559

# The launcher-sessions-callback-address is the address that sessions started through the Launcher
# use to contact Workbench. For a single-node Workbench installation with the Local Launcher
# Plugin, and not using SSL (the default configuration), localhost should suffice.
# If you set the rserver's www-port, or ssl-enabled, you must update this address to match.
#
# For more information about configuring this correctly in more complex environments, see this
# section of the admin guide:
# https://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/job_launcher/configuration.html
